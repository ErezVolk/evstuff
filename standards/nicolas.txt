- Do maybe 5 minutes of scales etc., unless getting back into shape after a period away from the instrument
- Connect exercises to musicality. Work both with and without a metronome
- Ex: chords ATB by a standard
- Work on Barry Harris' ii-V phrase
- Work on creating a simple, clear, blues (e.g.) head
- Study Cherokee and make a chorus on that, maybe only the A part
