Notes:
------
- Tricks from bass lines:
  - linear up/down but change octave down/up after first note (e.g., C ^Bb A G, Bb â†“C D F)
- How to get over confusion between "There Will Never Be Another You" and "But Not For Me" (the B/C parts)
  - And memorize actual chords, not roots
  - And effectively memorize relative
- On the lego thing:
  - Maybe a "collection of songs with specific lego block"?
  - Recognizing blocks (anki?) and joins vs. memorizing (another anki?)
  - How to connect song title to structure? Maybe via melody?
  - In a sense, the listening part is key
  - Finding the KEY points of a progression (or aren't these the joins?)
    - A key might be comparing different versions of the same song, like I started doing
    - What about substitutions etc.? Shouldn't those be stripped out?
  - Also should not forget durations
  - Once again, root movement is not enough; maybe the keyboard (/uke) is the key
  - On writing:
    - What about the Korean alphabet thing? Or shorthand (consonant=root, vowel=quality...?)
    - Some kind of hand-solfege-for-chord thing
    - Roots: 12(7), want to see circle in there; Chord types: Let's say (major 7, minor 7, dominant 7, half-dim, dim, maj-min, 6, m6, aug)
    - So basically the phonology of chord progressions
  - This is too much emphasis on graphic compactness, where's memorizing and hearing.
- Take a short line and play over many songs
- Hey, Israel Crosby reuses that Ab7-G7 line from "But Not for Me" on "Stompin' at the Savoy"
