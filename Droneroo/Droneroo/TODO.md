#  TODO List

- Proper gradient color background
- Audio settings in a window
- Pick a note NOW (wheel or something)
- Piano keyboard
- Support chords
- "About..." (how does that work in mobile?)
- Get clicks from a specific keyboard even when not in focus (maybe using Karabiner/BTT)
- Configurable and savable sequences
- Load specific instrument from soundbank (echo 'inst 1' |fluidsynth foobar.sf2)
- Chord (or anything) which then moves according to the circle defined, i.e., pattern relative to current
