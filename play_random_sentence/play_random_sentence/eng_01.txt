355041	Happy birthday, Muiriel!
1283*	The password is "Muiriel".
1009347*	I'll return immediately.
349064*	I don't know.
1009345*	I don't know what I should say.
1287*	This is never going to end.
36019*	What should I say?
1290*	I was in the mountains.
1009352*	I don't know if there is time.
328546*	For some reason the microphone didn't work earlier.
1009351	I make 100 euros per day.
915342*	I may give up soon and just take a nap.
1009350	That's because you don't want to be alone.
1009349*	That sort of thing won't happen.
1009348*	He's strange sometimes.
1304	I'll do my best not to disturb your studying.
1306	I suppose it's different when you think about it over the long term.
1308*	I miss you.
1009357	I'll call after going home tomorrow.
1009356	I always liked strange personalities.
1311*	You should sleep.
2247573*	I will go.
1313*	I told them to send me another ticket.
1009354*	You really annoy me.
1315*	I can't live that kind of life.
1316*	I once wanted to be an astrophysicist.
1317*	I never liked biology.
1318*	The last person I told my idea to thought I was nuts.
1320	It is unfortunately true.
1322*	Most people think I'm crazy.
2505024*	That's my line.
373216*	Really?
1327	Then there is a problem...
1328	Oh, there's a butterfly!
2249134*	It's not surprising.
1332	For some reason I feel more alive at night.
1333*	It depends on the context.
270147*	Are you kidding?
1337*	When I grow up, I want to be a king.
1586987	If you want to earn money, America is the best.
1023662*	I'm extremely fat.
1473574	And now, what?
1341	I'm gonna shoot him.
1343	I'm just saying!
1344*	That was probably what influenced their decision.
1345*	I've always wondered what it'd be like to have siblings.
1346	This is what I would have said.
1347*	It would take forever for me to explain everything.
1348	That's because you're a girl.
1349	Sometimes I can't help showing emotions.
1353*	Let's consider the worst that could happen.
1354*	How many close friends do you have?
502319*	That's how it is.
1357*	I think it is best not to be impolite.
1358	One can always find time.
1360*	Back in high school, I got up at 6 a.m. every morning.
1363	I thought you liked to learn new things.
1366*	In order to do that, you have to take risks.
1367	Every person who is alone is alone because they are afraid of others.
1368*	Why do you ask?
1370	I can't tell her now. It's not that simple anymore.
1372*	Whenever I find something I like, it's too expensive.
1373*	How long did you stay?
1374	Maybe it will be exactly the same for him.
1375	Innocence is a beautiful thing.
1376*	Humans were never meant to live forever.
1897793*	That's interesting.
1467398	Are you saying you intentionally hide your good looks?
1382	If anyone was to ask what the point of the story is, I really don't know.
1383*	I didn't know where it came from.
1384	I think my living with you has influenced your way of living.
1385*	This is not important.
1386*	I didn't like it.
1388	You're just running away from life's problems.
1389	If you look at the lyrics, they don't really mean much.
1390*	There's a problem there that you don't see.
1391*	You can do it.
1392*	My physics teacher doesn't care if I skip classes.
1393*	I wish I could go to Japan.
1394*	I hate it when there are a lot of people.
1397*	I won't ask you anything else today.
1398*	It may freeze next week.
1399*	Even though he apologized, I'm still furious.
1400	The police will get you to find the bullets.
3591700*	That wasn't what I intended.
1403*	Thanks for your explanation.
2254558*	What has happened?
1407	It almost scared me not to see you online for a whole day.
2669788*	I don't understand what you mean.
1409	My computer has got to be useful for something.
1410	You wanted to tell me about freedom?
473877	If you want to hear a scary story, I'll tell you about a dream I had a few weeks ago.
1413	One can't expect everything from schools.
1414*	There are many words that I don't understand.
1420*	Can it be phrased in another way?
276369*	Who knows?
2253735*	This looks interesting.
1424	Except that here, it's not so simple.
1425*	I like candlelight.
416890*	How did you reply?
1427	No, he's not my new boyfriend.
1429	You never have class or what?!
416891*	What is the problem?
2764309*	The only thing we can do is wait.
1433*	It's not much of a surprise, is it?
1434*	I love you.
1435*	I don't like you anymore.
1437*	Congratulations!
1438*	I don't want to wait that long.
1439*	Why don't you come visit us?
1440	But the possibility seems unlikely.
1442*	I shouldn't have logged off.
1443*	I don't know what to do anymore.
1444	It is inevitable that I go to France someday, I just don't know when.
1445*	I hate chemistry.
1446*	I didn't want this to happen.
1447	You can probably guess what happens though.
1448	Next thing you know, you'll be in the papers.
416892*	What other options are there?
1412446*	I don't like traveling all that much.
276471*	Everyone has both strong and weak points.
2735714	Seriously though, episode 21 made me laugh so hard I almost cried.
1455	It only shows you're not a robot.
1458*	It's not something anyone can do.
1459*	I don't know if I still have it.
1460*	What do you think I've been doing?
1461*	Don't underestimate my power.
894773	My mother doesn't speak English very well.
1212557*	That's where the problem is.
1466	How do you find food in outer space?
1467*	All you can do is trust one another.
1468*	Everyone wants to meet you. You're famous!
416893	Why say sorry for something you haven't even done?
1422481	Foreigners are interesting, aren't they?
1473*	What keeps you up so late?
1475*	I don't have anyone who'd travel with me.
1480	Nothing is beautiful but the truth.
1481*	Tomorrow, he will land on the moon.
1069888*	I can't speak Japanese.
1483*	This is a pun.
1484*	Nobody understands me.
1485*	I learned to live without her.
1486	It's useless to keep on thinking any more.
1487*	I have too many things on my mind these days.
1488*	I just wanted to check my email.
1496*	It would take me too much time to explain to you why it's not going to work.
1497	I'm so dumb... I'm trying to explain things to you that I don't understand myself.
393061	Stop thinking of me as just an average person.
25196*	Would you like to drink anything?
1505	Who is it? "It's your mother."
1507	What's the matter? asked the little white rabbit.
1511	To tell you the truth, I am scared of heights. "You are a coward!"
1512	Trust me, he said.
1513*	This is what I was looking for! he exclaimed.
1514*	This looks pretty interesting, Hiroshi says.
1515	Their communication may be much more complex than we thought.
1516	The phone is ringing. "I'll get it."
1517	That's very nice of you, Willie answered.
508289	Thanks for the help. "Don't mention it."
1519	Someday I'll run like the wind.
1521*	Please don't cry.
1522*	Let me know if there is anything I can do.
1523	It may be that the happiness awaiting us is not at all the sort of happiness we would want.
1396362*	I want a boat that'll take me far away from here.
1527	I feel like playing cards. "So do I."
1528	Haven't we met somewhere before? asked the student.
446085	A Japanese person would never do such a thing.
1532	Communism will never be reached in my lifetime.
1535*	If you see a mistake, then please correct it.
1537	The Germans are very crafty.
731366*	If you don't eat, you'll die.
1539	How do you spell "pretty"?
380740*	Shall we go home?
1541*	I'm sorry, I can't stay long.
1543	Why aren't you going? "Because I don't want to."
1544*	One million people lost their lives in the war.
72637	I came to Tokyo three years ago and have been living here ever since.
622183	I lived in Nagoya for over a month.
1553	Oh, my white pants! And they were new.
1555	When I left the train station, I saw a man.
505774	And nobody helped you?
2218081*	You're an angel.
1558	People from Madrid are weird.
1560	You're lucky because he didn't bite you.
1563*	Are they all the same?
2057650*	Thanks.
1235191*	Excuse me. Where are the eggs?
1567*	It's a surprise.
42034*	That is a good idea.
1570	It's a pity when somebody dies.
1573	Pull into shape after washing.
1183217	Do not open before the train stops.
1578*	They say love is blind.
1584	Seeing that you're not surprised, I think you must have known.
1586	This will be a good souvenir of my trip around the United States.
73822	It is difficult to keep up a conversation with someone who only says Yes and No.
1590	Do you speak Italian?
73968	I can't think with that noise, she said as she stared at the typewriter.
1592	It is said that "Hamlet" is the most interesting play ever written.
1594*	May I ask a question?
1230717	How do you feel? he asked.
1597*	It's impossible for me to explain it to you.
1600*	I would never have guessed that.
1602*	You'll forget about me someday.
1603*	That is rather unexpected.
1604*	I wonder how long it's going to take.
1605*	I can't live without a TV.
1606*	I couldn't have done it without you. Thank you.
1607*	Nothing is achieved without effort.
1608	Many people drift through life without a purpose.
2065609*	Life without love has no meaning.
1230706*	Let me know if I need to change.
1611	I think exams are ruining education.
1612*	We can't sleep because of the noise.
1613	Do you have a condom?
73381*	I can walk to school in ten minutes.
1617*	It took me more than two hours to translate a few pages of English.
910832	May I talk to Mr. Brown?
1621	Ah! is an interjection.
1622*	What do you want?
1627	Paris is the most beautiful city in the world.
1629	Hey, I may have no money, but I still have my pride.
1630*	I have a dream.
470201*	If you are by my side, I don't need anything else.
1643	What do you mean you don't know?!
282413	This is silly!
758904	My name's Jack.
1650*	I have to go shopping. I'll be back in an hour.
2765412*	I like it a lot.
899088*	Would you like to meet tomorrow?
1649*	How do you say that in Italian?
1651*	Is it far from here?
1653	Thanks, that's all.
1654*	Would you like to dance with me?
5804556	何時ですか？
370703*	Where are you from?
408293*	What's your name?
1658*	Italy is a very beautiful country.
321324*	It's not my fault.
1660*	I'd like to stay for one night.
1663*	Where are the showers?
1666*	I have lost my wallet.
436281*	I agree.
1668	Love is never wasted.
1671	He's very sexy.
27641*	Leave me alone.
1673	Pass me the salt, please. "Here you are."
1674*	There are too many things to do!
436243*	How old are you?
1678	Stop asking me for a drink! Go get it yourself.
1679*	Thanks to you I've lost my appetite.
1682	It has been so long since I last went to Disneyland with my family.
1683	My parents keep arguing about stupid things. It's so annoying!
1684*	If you don't want to put on sunscreen, that's your problem. Just don't come complaining to me when you get a sunburn.
1685	My friends always say I'm too calm, but my family always says I'm too annoying.
694423*	It's very hot today.
2249627*	Nobody showed up.
5077168*	I've never seen a red refrigerator.
2869993*	He didn't keep his promise.
1696	My eyes are an ocean in which my dreams are reflected.
1698*	Look at me when I talk to you!
1699*	What would the world be without women?
1700*	What if you gave a speech and nobody came?
1704*	How did you come up with this crazy idea?
1705*	I'm tired.
1706*	Who wants some hot chocolate?
1707	Speak more slowly, please!
462578*	The bill, please.
1711	And what are we going to do?
456425*	My head hurts.
1582614	Where can I make a phone call?
1714	I must admit that I snore.
2785958*	I'm going to church tonight.
1716*	How are you? Did you have a good trip?
1717*	I don't feel well.
2245027*	Call the cops.
925077*	It is too expensive.
1722*	We're getting out of here. The cops are coming.
1723*	Merry Christmas!
1724	It would be so cool if I could speak ten languages!
1727	It's a complete mess, and it's getting on my nerves.
1736*	He would be glad to hear that.
1739*	Don't ask what they think. Ask what they do.
1741	What changes the world is communication, not information.
1743	If you don't understand something, it's because you aren't aware of its context.
1748*	Why is life so full of suffering?
1753*	I would like to give him a present for his birthday.

1758*	I am married and have two children.
1759*	He plays the piano very well.
1760	I see it rarely.
1761*	I'd like to study in Paris.
1762*	You don't know who I am.
2765281*	Why don't you eat some vegetables?
1769	In a dictionary like this one there should be at least two sentences with "fridge".
1771*	The wind calmed down.
1783*	That was the best day of my life.
1784*	I don't understand German.
2111662*	I've decided.
2111800*	I promise.
1801*	I find foreign languages very interesting.
1802	I don't like learning irregular verbs.
1806	You make me dream.
1807	I'm beside myself with joy.
945288	寒いです。
2999617	のどが渇いた。
411667*	You're right.
2772519*	You did it on purpose, didn't you?
983814*	You mean you didn't tell him anything?
1824*	Could you call again later, please?
1825*	Who am I talking with?
1827	Smile now, cry later!
1838*	What made you change your mind?
1848	This baby penguin is too cute!
257113*	I need your help.
1860*	I don't want to go to school.
1861	It's over between us. Give me back my ring!
456237*	It's raining.
1864*	She's really smart, isn't she?
1874*	Tomorrow, I'm going to study at the library.
1894557*	It's too late.
1876*	I went to the zoo yesterday.
1879*	I make lunch every day.
1880*	I watched TV this morning.
1882*	I slept a little during lunch break because I was so tired.
3567588*	I live near the sea so I often go to the beach.

1944	As the plane was approaching turbulence, the pilot asked the passengers aboard the plane to fasten their seat belts.
1625846	A small forest fire quickly spread and became a huge conflagration.
2768601*	I was late for school.
2027	I think I'm gonna sneeze. Give me a tissue.
2031	But you've never told me about this!
2036	Sorry, I don't think I'm gonna be able to.
2037*	You had plenty of time.
2040*	I'm almost done.
2042*	How many sandwiches are there left?
1053374*	It's pitch black outside.
2049*	What happened? There's water all over the apartment.
2050	During summer breaks, I ate dinner at midnight.
2054	Never try to die.
2066*	What are you talking about?

2068*	I knew that today would be fun.
2073*	When are we eating? I'm hungry!
386739*	I don't like school.
2075*	I have class tomorrow.
1050524	Thanks. "You're welcome."
2079*	Winter is my favorite season.
2083*	I learned a lot from you.
2096*	He disappeared without a trace.
2098	There cannot be progress without communication.
2097*	I can place the palms of my hands on the floor without bending my knees.
2105*	This place has a mysterious atmosphere.
2106*	I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this matter.
2107	So what if I am gay? Is it a crime?
1412473	My life is empty without him.
2110*	My mother bought two bottles of orange juice.
2111*	She was wearing a black hat.
2112*	We made pancakes for breakfast.

2114*	I spent the whole afternoon chatting with friends.
2116*	Are you just going to stand there all day?
2119	He wishes to erase bad memories.
2121*	Your secret will be safe with me.
2122*	I don't want to hear any more of your complaining.
1396371*	You should've rejected such an unfair proposal.
2126	Mathematics is not just the memorization of formulas.
416368*	I didn't mean to give that impression.

30713*	Can you imagine what our life would be like without electricity?
2139*	His story was too ridiculous for anyone to believe.

2168*	Where are you?
416367*	Where are you going?
2260*	Take good care of yourself.

2220910*	Do you take plastic?
2420*	I'll bring you the bill immediately.
2425*	I'm sorry, I don't have change.
2429*	I want you to tell me the truth.
516611	The film began at 2.
2441*	I'm glad to see you back.
2444*	Tell me what happened.
1191061	Maria's hair is long.

6005	Nara is a quiet and beautiful city.
251134*	My hobby is listening to music.
2078136*	No matter how much I think about it, I don't understand it.

6041*	How come you know so much about Japanese history?
6054*	He was born on July 28th, 1888.
328731*	It's not worth reading any further.
328730*	Why can't I sing like they can?
328729	If you keep on like this, you'll probably live to reach 120!
627947	This house and this land is mine!
328722*	My husband and daughter are fast asleep.
328702	However, the survivors are unaware of that fact.
328669	Then, those from a year ago won't be working any more!
1357284*	It's not a joke.
328219	We are now going to move to the crematorium so if Mr. Ogawa and you would enter the car ...
328207	The other day, a water quality inspection was carried out at our house. We had it done by a certain famous company's Environment Analysis Center or some such name.
328184	Yes. I'm pretty sure there are complimentary tickets that haven't been used somewhere.
2161*	I want an MP3 player!
2900196*	That'll cost thirty euros.
1665448	Good morning. You were a bit late today. "Mhm, I got a tad delayed."
328168	You're considerate, but don't you think you should work a little more at understanding the subtleties of the human mind?
328161	That was another impressive fall-flat-on-your-face ... Hey, you alright, Sophie? Can you stand?
328160	Even making an international phone call from a mobile, if it's Mobila then you can do it for 20 Yen per minute.
328152	This, appearing at first glance to be perfectly obvious, is actually very difficult.
651021	My brother died suddenly two years ago. Since then, my sister-in-law has valiantly kept the small jewelery store he left her going.
328141	There aren't many blokes that nice!
328140	Guys that handsome are few and far between.
328139	OK, this next! The combination of this and this might be way sexy!
328138	I started to think I had behaved foolishly.
328135	We're what they colloquially call a single mother family. I haven't seen my father's face.
328132	Situation report. "At present 4 in sight. At most probably 7. Holding small calibre arms."
328129	I'm sure it's tough taking part in the activities of two clubs, but good luck!
328128	Well, for the practical problem, in the midst of those rumours flying around I'm surprised they've been able to keep that club running.

284995*	Will you sell your house to him?
68180*	What happened to him?

811561	One way or the other we made him understand it.
402073*	What I told you about him also applies to his brother.
403603*	I warned you not to get near him, didn't I?
284594*	Don't let him touch it.
284564*	If he finds out, certainly he will be very angry.
284561*	Please pour him a glass of beer.
284536	As soon as she met him, she burst into tears.
284502*	I found it difficult to get along with him.
284497	A gulf divided him from them.
284491*	When I talked with him on the phone, he sounded tired.
284466*	I have nothing in common with him.
284454*	I'm looking forward to seeing him.
284449	I had to choose going with him or staying here alone.
258583*	I met him for the first time.
284429*	I haven't met him.
284423	He and I have a near-telepathic understanding of each other. No sooner does one of us say something than the other is already responding.
284398	Not a day passes without having an argument with him.
284397*	I don't think I can get along with him.
284382	He's supposed to be living in Nagano. What's he doing at Tokyo station?
284378	Isn't my boyfriend terrible? He always takes me to see horror movies, even though he knows I don't like them. I hate it.
1423854	To hear him talk, you might think he's a girl.
1312933*	When he spoke, everyone became silent.

284315*	I will wait here till he comes.
284296*	I am doubtful whether he will come.
284294*	I doubt if he will come.
263200*	We will start when he comes.
284267*	Will you let me know when he comes?
284266*	Let's do it when he comes.
284265*	I'll tell him so when he comes.
284244*	He is likely to win the championship.
284235*	Let's wait till he comes back.
284226	The hope of his return encouraged me.
284205	There is no hope of his coming back safe.
284191*	I can't figure out what he really wants.
284186*	He had been reading for two hours when she came in.
284183*	All he wanted was time to finish his painting.
284161	He had no sooner gone out of the room than all of them burst out laughing.
303397*	He came into the room.
284140	Just because he is poor, it does not follow that he is unhappy.
414634*	It seems obvious that he is sick.
284103*	It was uncertain whether he would marry her.
284101*	He's in charge of the sales department.
284094*	There is no hope of his being appointed.
1317009	He's a famous physicist not only in Japan, but throughout the world.
284079*	He has been in Japan for three years.
284074*	His sudden appearance surprised us all.
284070*	The crowd yelled when he scored a goal.
260124*	I saw him cross the street.
503772*	He doesn't need to work.
284034*	I saw him enter the store.
284002*	He sent me a birthday card.
69039*	Who do you think he is?
260118*	I don't know who he is.
15845*	Do you know who he is?
15845*	Do you know who he is?
283992	I really like him!
283988*	He acted like he owned the place.
283982*	I've never heard him speak ill of others.
283975*	I saw him running.
283971*	It's unusual for him to get up early.
400162*	There's hardly any hope that he'll win the election.
283968*	Is there any possibility that he'll win the election?
283965	He is the boy of whom I spoke the other day.
283960	He brings home the bread and butter.
283954*	There is little, if any, hope of his being alive.
283953*	There is no hope of his being alive.
283952*	I don't know whether he is dead or alive.
283951*	I was relieved to hear that he was alive.
283927*	I admit that he is right.
283924*	There isn't any hope of his success.
283923	There is very little hope of his success.
2525294	His success depends on the work he puts in.
283900*	He owes his success to good luck.
283780	I accept that he was telling the truth.
1427922*	I've never heard him complaining about his meals.
283864*	There is little chance of his winning.
283847*	I heard him go out.
283834	It has slowly dawned upon us that he will not help.
283829*	He guaranteed my debt.
283828*	I saw him wash the car.
283815*	I am afraid he will make a mistake.
283807*	I didn't know he had decided to leave his job.
283803*	There is no reason why he should resign.
283787*	There is not much possibility of his coming on time.
400173*	You can't depend on him to be punctual.
283780	I accept that he was telling the truth.
283752*	I began to understand the reason why he hated me.
283751*	He came to my rescue.
283746*	I saw him looking at me.
283736*	If he had taken my advice, he would now be rich.
283734*	He went in place of me.
283711*	Three years have passed since he died.
283710*	He has been dead for five years.
283704*	The evening he died was stormy.
283701*	It was yesterday that he died.
283700	I was surprised at the news of his death.
246351	The news that he died was a shock to me.
400145	The news of his death spread around.
283685*	I am certain that he will quit his job.
2768617*	He came first.
461197*	Do you know why he skipped class today?
283650*	I don't know if he will visit us next Sunday.
283642*	I wish he were here now.
283641	I copied in my notebook whatever he wrote on the blackboard.
283629*	I like him.
283615*	What he said turned out to be true.
283599*	What he said turned out to be false.
283599*	What he said turned out to be false.
283609*	What he said is not true.
283588	I have no idea where he is at present.
283587*	There was an awkward silence when he appeared.
398532	When he appeared, the party livened up.
283574*	How did you know that he is married?
283570*	I am convinced that he is innocent.
283555	I never counted on his being rich.
498064*	Just because he's rich, doesn't mean he's happy.
283552*	I caught him stealing the money.
283548*	He moved into my neighborhood.
283536*	The reason he was absent was that he had a severe headache.
283535	His absence was due to illness.
283534*	He was elected chairman.
253983	I saw at once that he was ill at ease.
283528	Upon returning home, he found a letter in the mailbox.
283527	I suggested to her that we go to the movies after he came home.
283520*	Let's leave as soon as he gets back.
391600	It rained as soon as he got home.
283516*	Let's leave things as they are until he comes back.
283511	He came back not because he was homesick, but because he was running short of money.
283489*	Did you see him go out?
1972277*	Just because he likes painting doesn't mean he's good at it.
283481	It's true that he saw a monster.
283480	I am suspicious of him.
283479*	It is this window that he broke.
283478*	There is no hope of his recovery.
283477	It's even chances that he will get well.
283476	There is little, if any, hope of his recovery.
1042489	There is little hope that he will recover.
400138*	Is there any chance that he'll recover?
400138*	Is there any chance that he'll recover?
283463*	I wish he had attended the meeting.
283461*	I expect that he will help us.
283458	He is commander of our troops.
283456*	He sang a song.
282936*	I don't know for certain when he will arrive.
283439*	There is no telling what time he will come.
283431*	Do you know what he said?
283426*	No matter what he says, don't trust him.
283426*	No matter what he says, don't trust him.
283422*	I don't care what he does.
283412*	We don't care what he does.
283418*	Do you know what he has done?
283413*	Guess what he told me.
283407*	I heard him coming downstairs.
283398	To hear him speak English, you would mistake him for an Englishman.
283384*	The car he's driving is not his.
612079*	He's the most likely to succeed.
283366*	The fact that he did not accept any money shows that he is an honest man.
283360*	If he had taken his doctor's advice, he might still be alive.
283357	It is clear that he is a great artist.
283353*	I was annoyed with him for interrupting me.
283352*	He acted as our guide.
283345*	Have you heard from him?
283344*	I had a phone call from him.
283323*	Do you often hear from him?
283325*	I couldn't get a definite answer from him.
283316	It is not probable that he will get well.
283314*	He thought of a good solution.
283312*	It is clear that he is guilty.
283305*	I wish he would write more often.
283304*	If he had studied harder, he would have passed the exam.
1265281	Let's wait here until he comes back.
283298	I saw him playing cards with all of them.
460926*	Did you know that he bought a condominium?
283295	No sooner had he struck the match than the bomb exploded.
283292*	He hasn't come yet.
283275	It is doubtful whether he did his homework by himself.
283270*	He played the piano and she sang.
283246*	I can't figure out why he said so.
283240*	I don't know what plan he will try.
1317116*	It doesn't matter what excuse he gives me, I can't forgive him.
283229	He told us such a funny story that we all laughed.
391970*	Nobody knows where he has gone.
283222*	Do you know where he went?
391969	Nobody knows where he has escaped to.
283205*	I don't know what has become of him.
1316122*	He can't have said such a stupid thing.
283181	He cannot have done such a silly thing.
283177	It is sad that he has been sick for such a long time.
283053	He cannot have said so.
283161	It is inconceivable to me that he would do such a thing.
283160*	He cannot have done such a thing.
283158	When he gets up on stage to sing one of his out-of-tune solos, I get so nervous for him that I get sweaty palms.
283141*	The moment he touched it, it blew up.
391974*	I have a feeling that he knows the secret.
283121	He assumed full responsibility for it.
283115*	He designed the car.
1427891*	If he doesn't accept the job, somebody else will.
283098*	He made up for the deficit.
283092	He is in charge of the class.
283077	It is strange that he should not tell me anything about it.
283071	His decision to stay there was a surprise to all of us.
283065	Small wonder that he thinks so.
283050	Seeing that he's not preparing at all, it seems that he's not planning to take the exam.
283048*	There is no hope that he will come soon.
283046	There is no hope of his getting well soon.
283041	What he did was nothing less than madness.
975639	His fart smelled.
283033	I thought it strange that he should be up so late.
283025*	He must have entered this room.
282995	Let's suppose that he is here.
282980*	Don't count on him to lend you any money.
282977	I will start after he comes.
282975*	I will go when he comes back.
282972	I caught him cheating in the examination.
282966	He is impatient to see you.

878433*	Why did he do such a thing?
38642*	I can't figure out why he didn't tell the truth.

4811485	There is a someone standing at the door.
39094*	Have you made sure the door is locked?
39095*	Could you move forward so we can close the door?

1288742*	I finally passed that test.
39893*	At last, we arrived at the village.
39929	I feel ashamed of having lost my temper.
39931	A foolish impulse made me say what I should have left unsaid.
39944*	Come here.
1317054*	Why don't we drop by to see her?
1318702*	I wanted to make some telephone calls.
39967	It might be a bit big but this envelope will do just fine. It's better to be too big than too small.

39974*	Would you mind waiting a few minutes?
433504*	Excuse me.
40010*	Let me think for a minute.

40058*	How about dropping in at the shop?
40060*	Let me have a look at the picture.

40065	A little bit of luck sometimes leads to an unexpected success.
40076*	I've been thinking that I may have been too critical.
40082	What do you say to having a coffee break?
1939683*	Please wait a minute.

825289*	Let's go out and eat dinner together from time to time.
40529*	Come and see me once in a while.
40534	It happened that I knew her by sight.
40554	It so happened that he was absent from school that day.
40562	Stop shooting the breeze and get to work!
40567	Maybe the impulse was working upon her subconscious.
40571*	The chances are that he will win.
40595*	Maybe he has lots of girlfriends.
40602	Double, please.
40641*	You'd better give up smoking.
40655*	Keep in mind that smoking is not good for your health.
40657	Smoking is dangerous to health.

40838	An ostrich does not fly through the air.
40853*	We have a visitor right now. Would you mind waiting for a while?
499998*	I'm just looking.
40876*	I would hate to become just a housewife.
40885	He just drones on and on but hardly even touches on what we need to know for the test.
40902*	I just wish we could leave this horrible place.
514989	I don't want to be used.
479016*	Can you call a taxi for me?
40943*	Will you please call me a taxi?
40952	The taxi seemed to go as slowly as a snail.
40960*	Taking a taxi is a luxury for me.
402907*	Many friends came to see me off.
40996	Though many books are published, hardly a few of them are of value.

41283*	Don't talk like that.
41297	You can't fool me with your honeyed words.
41304	Such a proposal would only be turned down immediately.
41324*	Nobody can get along with such a person.
41334	You don't have to go getting so hairy about such a small thing.
41370*	I never thought he was capable of doing something so cruel.
41378*	I can't afford to buy such an expensive car.
41403*	I've never heard of such a strange story.
41418	I am not having any of those lies.
41425*	That's why I was absent from school yesterday.
41431*	I cannot afford to buy such a thing.
387416*	That kind of thing can't be found just anywhere.
41448*	Stop staring at me like that.
41450	Never in my life have I seen such a terrible accident.
442964*	That's not fair.
41459	That's a piece of pie.
1097552	そんなに長い距離を歩いたなんて、彼は足が丈夫に違いない。
41490*	Don't run so fast.
41503	I wish you wouldn't drive so fast. You're making the baby sick!
41548*	Don't eat like a pig.
41552*	There's no need to panic. There's plenty of time.
41555*	I didn't quite catch the name of that designer.
41600	You've got a nerve to say such a thing!
41637*	I've never heard of such a thing.
41648*	I don't go in for that sort of thing.
41653*	I don't want to get involved in that sort of thing.
41665*	That cannot be true.
41670*	Don't let that happen again!
1345516	Stop inhaling your food. You should eat more slowly.
41685*	It's about time for dinner.
41686*	It's about time we went back.
41689*	It is time you told her the truth.
41690*	It's about time for him to get here.
41691*	It's almost time to go to bed.

41694*	It's about time we went to bed.
31574*	It's about time to start.
41696*	I think I have to begin working on my homework.
41697*	I'm afraid I have to go now.
1140088*	It's almost time.
2359736*	I've got to get out of here.

1337724*	Shouldn't we be going soon?
41705	Let's be going now.
41706*	I'm taking off now.
2064467*	It's about time you went to school.
41709*	It's about time I was going home.
522239	Maybe it's about time I started learning to do programming.
41712*	It's about time we brought this party to an end, isn't it?
41713	It's about time you set about cleaning the table.
41714*	I think it's time to wind up this meeting.
1397637*	The guests should be arriving soon.
2064468*	It's about time I was going.
41719*	Turn it off.
41749*	Will you send it by mail?
442977*	Please wrap it up.
41785	Why don't you look it up in the phone book?
41798*	It's naive of you to believe that.
41825*	Give it to me, please.
41858*	I tried in vain to open it.
41858*	I tried in vain to open it.
41886*	What are you going to do with it?
41909*	May I do it right now?
41920*	Did you show it to your parents?
41968	They were made of rough brown leather.
42026*	I had never been abroad before, so everything seemed strange to me.
42031*	That sounds too good to be true.
254847*	I'm glad to hear that.
442130*	That's a good idea.
42040*	It is about the size of an egg.
1300927*	That's a really great idea.
410776*	Those are my pants.
42104*	It is on me.
42113*	It was a one-sided love affair.
42168*	That's his specialty.
42195*	Is it Japanese food?
42209*	It serves you right.
2765400*	That's a big problem.
42312*	I just meant it as a joke.
42332	You are telling it second hand, aren't you?
449181*	It's no concern of mine.
42363*	It's in my jacket pocket.
42380	These are my grandmother's artificial teeth.
42440	It may occur at any moment.
442968*	Isn't it black?
42446*	It is too expensive for me to buy.
527961*	It wasn't expensive.
442966*	That isn't fair.
42474*	It is not as good as it looks.
42494*	Is it near your house?
42503	It was a casual meeting.
42523	It is a stupendous project.
42557*	What is the story?
1341458*	It's written in pencil, so you can erase it.
42572*	I put it in the drawer.
36518*	You have a point there.
42604*	It's worth a try.
42620*	That's quite meaningless.
42622*	It was just as I thought.
1372555*	It was a very beautiful flower.
42716*	That's quite a story.
42781*	When does it begin?
442130*	That's a good idea.
42804*	That's really sad.
42834*	It will be finished in a day or two.
464592*	What is that?
42850*	It's my favorite food.
1397633*	It'll cost about 2,000 yen to fix it.
954533*	What does that mean?
42981*	That would be fine.
43011*	Well, I must be going.
43036*	People don't say that anymore.
43038*	How do you feel about it?
43040	Those animals were in danger of dying out.
350133*	I'm leaving.
43065	Then that means I lost everything.
43068	Well then, I'll have chicken.
1318753*	I'm sure that is the truth.
43116*	It's my favorite song.
43130*	It was lucky for you that you found it.
43163*	I'd like to know the rest of the story.
43184	Then he stretched his legs and settled back in his seat.
43190*	That's exactly what he said.
43194*	I have no idea of what it is like.
1426428*	I made up my mind to do the work no matter how hard it might be.
43236*	Do you have any soft drinks?
43244*	Sit on the sofa and make yourself comfortable.
43318	The old lady has been rather feeble since her illness.
43330	The old woman knitted her brows.
43347*	The old man lives on his pension.
1304526*	That old man caught a large fish.
43377*	The old man was not as mean as he looked.
388651*	The old man was almost hit by a car.
43424*	The train will arrive at the station before noon.
43428	The train is traveling at the rate of 50 miles an hour.
43438*	The train was so crowded that I had to stand all the way.

43530	There were a lot of people who came to ask after the famous actress.
2307045*	Let's reconsider the problem.

43849*	I'll send the book by mail.
43855	It was not until I read the book that I knew about it.
43860*	Few people seem to have read the book.
43867*	It won't take long to read that book.
43894	You may borrow this book as long as you keep it clean.
43902*	Where did you buy that book?

72051	He's always talking like a big shot, but it won't be long before all his faults are exposed.
72052	He lives a freewheeling life. I think he ought to settle down a little.
72053*	He called me a stupid boy.
72061	It must have been something really big for him to strike a triumphant pose like that.
72069*	Two ice creams, please.
72077*	How awful!
72091	Oh, yes, I remember.

1886772*	What do I do next?
1890978*	I'm getting better.
1890996*	I'm going with Tom.
1891121*	I'm so embarrassed.
1553423*	It turned out well.
1994470*	I'm in trouble now.
1317272	John made Mary jump.

1860538*	Tell Tom I love him.
2062216*	I borrowed three books from the library.
1860402*	Don't touch my stuff.
1885989*	Don't you want to go?

1954833*	We can't see any stars tonight.
1886763*	What do you know about the CIA?
1961600*	I thought you didn't believe in ghosts.
1887844*	I told you I don't know how to do that.
1887897*	I want to watch what's on TV right now.
1887801*	I thought I told you never to go there alone.
1961280*	I thought I told you to keep the door closed.

1867839*	Tom took the bottle of Scotch from his briefcase and handed it to Mary.
1027668*	Yesterday, when Tom was backing up his car, he ran over Mary's bicycle.
1858712	Let's buy Tom a car for his graduation present. "That's a great idea."
1853743*	It's very interesting.
1441680*	Her book is very interesting.
1441679	His book is very interesting.
1745046	I have read your book. It's very interesting.

1961792*	I thought you'd agree with me.
1961797*	I thought you'd be at the bar.
1936545*	I'd like to ask you about Tom.
1961528*	I thought Tom was still in jail.
1887808*	I thought you grew up in Boston.
1961619*	I thought you liked being alone.
1102963*	Their hats are hanging over there.
1904466*	They don't want to get out of bed.
1804011	This is Tom's dirty little secret.
1552240*	Tom came home crying after school.
1951368*	Tom can't bring himself to say no.
2068059*	I am taking tomorrow off.
1961629*	I thought you might change your mind.

1970119*	I hear you have friends in the CIA.
1887499*	I know that Tom says he doesn't like me.
1887590*	I need to talk to you about your grades.
1887646*	I saw you carrying Mary's books for her.
1029776*	Tom and Mary woke up early to see the first sunrise of the year.
274630*	Could you show me another one?
22121*	All aboard!
268385	Could I have a transfer?
40083*	Hold on, please.
56851*	Give me a copy of this book.

917733	He has worked in this factory for 11 years.
1887478*	I know a guy who plays the guitar fairly well.
1887613*	I promise I'll mop the floor tomorrow morning.
1887674*	I spent the whole afternoon cleaning my house.
1027865*	Tom tried to catch up with Mary, but he couldn't.
1126835*	Tom wanted to become a sign language interpreter.
1867740*	Tom was smart not to sell his house at that time.
1893775*	We might not need to go to the supermarket today.
1893682*	We were supposed to help Tom yesterday afternoon.
1975757*	We've never actually been out on a date together.
1886714*	What was I wearing at that time? Do you remember?
1954778*	I can't remember the password I used for this website.
1955093*	I can't understand why Tom doesn't want to go with us.
1970141*	I expected to make new friends when I moved to Boston.
687345	He apologized to his wife and children for losing his temper.
1887445*	I just remembered that I was supposed to buy a loaf of bread.
1887750*	I think we need to be very careful not to hurt Tom's feelings.
918918	I've had a lot on my mind recently and have had trouble falling asleep at night.
1027509*	I think it's unlikely that Tom would be interested in buying your old MP3 player.
1994434*	Tom may be in trouble.
1898286*	Oh, by the way, I have something to show you.
3219433*	Are you still afraid?
1886295*	Are you threatening me?
1860751*	Call me when it's done.
1883002	I met him at Tom's house.
1887596*	I never gave you my name.
914058*	I never saw such a woman.
1887607*	I owe you an explanation.
1887630*	I really want to see you.
1887649*	I saw you talking to Tom.
1887740*	I think Tom lied to Mary.
1954627*	I can't make ends meet now.
1887223*	I don't feel sorry for Tom.
1887229*	I don't have any allergies.
44085*	Tom will paint the fence tomorrow.
1887246*	I don't know what happened.
1887280*	I don't want to hurt anyone.
519963*	I saw him.
65443*	The group of noisy boys was getting out of hand.
245612	If you are not firm with the children, they will get out of hand.
245615	The children are beginning to get out of hand.
60602*	This building changed hands several times.
326601	I'll try my hand at cooking.
43618	The resolution to the problem was close at hand.
46564	I washed my hands of the whole business.
1025524*	Tom's hands were tied behind his back.
1023824*	Tom's work is selling second-hand cars.
1886116*	Do we have to be nice to Tom?
1886102*	Do you have a picture of Tom?
1886101*	Do you have a search warrant?
1886043*	Do you understand everything?
1860498*	Don't do anything stupid, OK?
1860446*	Don't let Tom talk to anyone.
1860423*	Don't move unless I tell you.
1860409*	Don't talk to Tom about this.
1989713*	Are you enjoying the holidays?
1994475*	I won't get anyone in trouble.
1994446*	Tom got in trouble, didn't he?
1886616*	Where else would you like to go?
1886615*	Where exactly did you come from?
1886614*	Where exactly did you find that?
1886480*	Why don't you come over tonight?
1975695*	I haven't actually shot anyone yet.
1887403*	I heard that Tom crashed the party.
1887505*	I know Tom says he doesn't like me.
1887683*	I spent the whole morning with Tom.
1887706*	I think I'll give Tom an egg timer.
1887764*	I think we should get back to work.
1885942*	How come you didn't tell Tom about me?
1539641*	How did you get so good at backgammon?
1886181*	Did Tom tell Mary how many apples to buy?
1886171*	Did Tom tell you where he was last night?
324290*	He is kind.
2079993*	My uncle gave me this watch.
2079997*	I went swimming in the river.
17570*	Can you do that?
1860384*	Don't worry about Tom. He isn't a threat.
1885972*	Have you ever seen the man in this photo?
323576*	Wood burns.
1868261*	Tom hasn't had a fight with anybody lately.
1884484*	Tom just wants you to take care of his dog.
1960927*	Tom pinned a white corsage on Mary's dress.
1867939*	Tom saw Mary sitting alone on a park bench.
1961239*	I thought I heard someone knocking on the door.
1961270*	I thought I told you not to call Tom at school.
1961432*	I thought this building had a sprinkler system.
1884447*	Tom showed Mary a picture of John and another boy.
1867900*	Tom showed up at the party wearing a suit and tie.
1867867*	Tom stopped running and tried to catch his breath.
1027867*	Tom tried moving the bookcase without Mary's help.
1838050*	Tom was a professional gambler before he met Mary.
305888	They're on pins and needles.

4717652	I should've read the original work before watching the movie.
3143689	Can you distinguish between Americans and Canadians?
403295	A close neighbor is better than a distant relative.
3144195	If only there was more time.
5957284	Tom, quiet down a little!
5957283*	Excuse me, what station is this?
3180214	It looks like the temperature is going to drop tonight, so be careful not to catch a cold.
5957278	Today sure is hot! I wore the wrong kind of clothing.
3329506*	I wish I'd worn short sleeves.

4717738	Look, tomatoes which grew up listening to Mozart!
3182889	Don't expect too much from the food.
3192863*	You should calm down a little.
3179729	Those who want to use the bathroom should do so now.
3182883	It seems that it will rain starting this afternoon, so you should carry an umbrella.
3182882	You should stop peeking when people are using their cellphones.
4927627	He's the kind of boyfriend you really should break up with.
3182881	The more I think about the future, the more I worry. So, I've decided not to think about it anymore.
3179724	I have decided to weigh myself every day starting today.
3180199	The night bus service was suspended, so I decided to spend the night at my friend's house.
24683*	What're you waiting for?
4550609*	I have the feeling that I'll sleep well tonight.
262339*	I think so, too.
3179719	I feel like I did nothing but eat these past two days.
3179718*	It looks like today is not my lucky day.
3393613	Whenever I talk to my father, I realize that he has a lot more experience than I do.
3179712	We're a bit early, aren't we? "Let's find a café or something and kill some time there."
3179711	I made too many hamburger steaks.
3182878	I carelessly gave my email address to a stranger.
3182877	I'm a day late, but "Happy Birthday!".
4717577	Sorry, I complained a lot.
3182876	I'm sorry. Did I wake you up?

3165794*	Who do you think will win?
2545910*	I'm sorry if I hurt you.
3182860	I'd be happy if you'd call me Tom.

3182854	Sorry, what was your name?
3179682*	What kind of music do you usually listen to?
3182853	I'm sorry. I reflected on what I did. "Reflected on what you did? That's something that even a monkey could do!"
3189150*	I should've followed Tom's advice.
3195675	I should have continued ballet.
3195677	I shouldn't have trusted in someone like Tom.
3195674*	I should have worn a coat.
3195672*	You should have told me in advance.
3195544	I should have studied my French seriously.

3195498	Have more confidence in yourself.
3195500	I want to eat soft serve ice cream.
687366	What is your job?
3192862	That isn't a literal translation, it's just plain wrong.
2539854*	I was thinking the exact same thing.
3195486	Don't bother getting annoyed over something like that.
3195488	Your replies have been slow lately. Have you been busy?
3195489*	I forgot I was in Australia.
3195492	Go ahead and say so if it hurts.
3195494	Your seal or signature here, please.
3195505	Sorry for bad-mouthing you the other time.
3195511	Tom, you look kind of green. "Do I?" "Is something wrong?" "There's nothing wrong."
3195512*	I'll tell you the truth if you promise not to get mad.
3195513	Thanks for hearing me out despite being so busy with work.
5933607	I talk to myself a lot, but there's no need to worry.
3195515	I wish I had a cute little brother or a cool older brother.
3195516	Looks like bringing gloves along was a good idea.

3200286	It's been a really long day, huh.
3200287	Your speech was great. "Really? Thanks!"
3200302	I'm sorry, Tom. "Why are you apologizing?" "I was just thinking that I might be bothering you." "No, you aren't bothering me at all."
3200309	Don't tell me you're already drunk. "I'm not, I'm not drunk."
3689987	Please give me your full name. "Tom Miller."

3255271	Sorry for not contacting you recently.
4817126*	As long as you are thinking about the pros and cons of a relationship, I don't think you can call it love.
5150312	I'm not in a homework-finishing mood.
3022596*	I don't get enough sleep.
6637343	You don't need to apologize, Tom. I fell in love with you all on my own.

4533465*	Have you put on sunscreen?
3274497	Even after I get a job, I think I'll still want to continue some form of music.
3255255	This sweater irritates my neck.

5288772	I wish I had never been born.
2543494*	I'm really glad I came here.
3583262*	Are you going to the party today?
3583261	I like writing novels more than reading them.
4805514*	I should've read the instructions.
4644969	That was a strange dream. "What happened?"
2447450*	How's your new job going?
5516208	Do you know what PDF stands for?
3583255	These days everything I do is bad for my health.
3583250	If you're tired, go to bed already.
2548574*	Tom is very famous.
3583248	How old is your child?
2991688*	How many hours a day do you sleep?
4642876	Is there anything you've been particularly interested in lately?
3583244	Would you stop treating me like a child just because I suck at English?
5907001	I've become sleepy.
2451366*	Why did you decide to study French?
4641795	I've got a bit of interest in learning French, but isn't it hard? "Not at all. It's 100 times easier than English!" "Really?" "Well, at least to me it is." "That's because you're native though"
3642446*	Are you interested in baseball, Tom?
6029136	Are you interested in fashion or make-up?
2064804*	Are you waiting for something?
2095429*	Are you waiting for someone?
5147452	What kind of women's attire does Tom like?
1495841*	Where did you meet Tom?
4647683	Have you ever been here before? "No, It's my first time here."
2633393*	I want to leave school.
3579799	Thus fought the Okinawan people.
3203760*	I'll do it if you tell me how to do it.
4717757*	I wonder if my life is worth living.
4717575	I don't need such superficial friends.
4642853	Who needs friends! They'll just betray you in the end.
4942073	Do you know the movie Avatar?
1841493*	Do you know where Tom is?
3584928	Do you know why cactus have needles?
3584927*	Do you know when Tom's birthday is?
3584926*	Do you know where Boston is?
23912	Do you know kabuki?
23912	Do you know kabuki?
2092563*	Do you know anybody in Boston?
3587322*	Why do you know so much about Australia?
2247869*	I'll try again.
3571922*	Are there any cute girls in your class?
1487664*	How old do I look?
755282	I have a sore stomach.
3591473*	The light has turned green.
3591425*	Would it be OK if I turned off the lights?
1839483*	I didn't say that.
4634890	Do you fancy anyone?
4404058	Do you have friends in your class?
4644970	Is Tom about? "He's not here!"
5136441*	Where did all that self-confidence come from?
3590468*	Does an electric wheelchair require a driver's license?
3856475*	Why do you know that?
23957*	What do you do in your free time?
6561686	When did you start using that cellphone?
2239590	Do you have a favorite singer?
24655*	Why do you think so?
497934*	I've got a headache.
464592*	What is that?
3621377	Eternal love doesn't exist.
3994465	Crap, I spent too much money.
3181756*	What are you all talking about?
3592865*	Hasn't Tom arrived yet?
3642463*	Don't you remember what you said?
3593696*	How long has it been since you've seen your boyfriend?
4717527	Is there anything you want to try when you grow up?
3593617*	Haven't you eaten lunch?
3593692*	How many years has it been since you've had a girlfriend?
4369144*	When was the last time you rode a bicycle?

3608234*	Haven't you eaten yet?
6544473	When did you buy that phone?
3150486*	When did you buy this car?
43902*	Where did you buy that book?
687604*	Where did you buy that dress?
1886632*	Where did you buy this guitar?
2833868*	Where did you buy these shoes?
2548475*	Where're you going?
4187891*	How did you make this soup?
3642451*	Was it a lie when you said you loved me?
5265701	Thanks, Tom. You're actually the only one who tells me that.
3739822*	I wish everything Tom said was a lie.
3605208*	I was an idiot to believe Tom.
4717560	Boys are all morons, eh...
5006709	Do girls also masturbate?
5260117	What do you think of girls who become kissaholics when drunk?
6106081*	What a sad thing to say.
3596350*	Don't state the obvious.
509618*	I'm sorry, I forgot to do my homework.
3642454*	I'm sorry, I left my homework at home.
5147434	Defy convention.
2009001*	Don't tell me that.
873821*	What makes you say that?
3596612*	Don't even say that as a joke.
3596850*	No matter what, don't tell Tom.
3596850*	No matter what, don't tell Tom.
3598986	Absolutely do not tell other people.
3598996	It's kept secret from Tom.
2235695*	Don't tell Tom.
2235695*	Don't tell Tom.
3598969*	Don't look so sad.
3598935*	Don't grow up to be like me.
6478527	I took my rival seriously.
3789181*	Excuse me, do you know what time it is?
4645095	What's this shop? "Should we go in and have a look?" "OK."
3603648*	Don't be so pessimistic.
3605940	It's not your fault, so don't worry.
3605917	Wait, have you washed the lettuce? "Stop worrying over the little things."
3606689	Why do you always speak to me in English? Is it because I'm a foreigner?
3608109*	Do you know where my key is?
459048*	Don't underestimate me.
3608144	If you think that you'll learn to speak English just by going to America, then you're sorely mistaken.
3608172	If somebody wants to bad-mouth you, you should just let them say whatever they want. It's a waste of time to get bothered by it.
3608141	I think that, in tough times, you can cry as much as you want.
3628416	Don't look at me that way, or I'll fall even deeper in love with you.
3550166*	I didn't expect to see you at a place like this.
6616077	What's Tom's dream school?
4717529	It's not your fault, don't worry.
3613310*	Tom, I think you should eat more.
662140*	Thank you for helping me with my homework.
3610579*	Be careful not to drink too much.
5136449*	Can you eat this?
4717774*	You have to get up early tomorrow. Why don't you go to bed?
3612977*	I'm sorry for calling so late. I just wanted to hear your voice.
3616231*	Is that all you want to say?
3614724*	It's a fascinating read.
1887110*	I can take a message.
3616228*	Good luck on your test.
4717571*	It's obviously a lie.
890143	Your face looks pale. Are you OK? Maybe it would be better if you went to the hospital, don't you think?
4717665*	By the way, did you find the umbrella you said you'd lost the other day?
6561685	Don't talk with that smiling face.
2484513*	Do you live near here?
3626822*	I forgot that today was Saturday.
4564116*	Do you want to go to the station with me?
17913*	I haven't the faintest idea what you mean.
3628447*	Who was that you were just talking to?
4997108	Even children would know things like that.
3628445*	Who did you hear that rumor from?
4525588*	Who was the girl you were with the other day?
4717491	Put some clothes on, you'll catch a cold.
6477060	Why are you crying? I'm feeling bad.
4639322	わあびっくりした！ 急に大きな声出さないでよ。
4404074*	Is there anything you want to eat?
6485478	Have you already forgotten what you just said?
256362*	I want to eat something.
1869545*	I want to eat steak.
4569160*	I want to eat something delicious.
1103101*	Today I want to eat something light.
961889*	I want to eat Korean food.
3777895*	I want to eat some Korean food that isn't spicy.
3777898*	I want to eat Chinese noodles.
3777900	I want to eat either ice cream or shaved ice.
3777902*	I want to eat pizza.
3665218*	I want to eat something sweet.
3777905*	I want to eat something that isn't sweet.
5365959	I want to eat something that can only be eaten here.
3652327*	I want to eat something that's not hot and spicy.
3777909*	It's cold, so I want to eat something hot.
3777910*	It's hot, so I want to eat something cold.
3642095	If it's that hot, how about you take off all your clothes?
1771881	もう１１時だ。
1396333*	It's already eleven.
5516203*	If we don't hurry, we'll be late.
3643166*	How is your new class?
5150011	Have you got used to the new class?
24391*	Which do you like better, summer or winter?
4168863*	Tom, which do you prefer, girls with long hair or girls with short hair?
4525583*	Which do you prefer, dogs or cats?
5863861	Do you like tea with milk or lemon?
4641485	It's been a while since I've seen milk in a bottle. "Me too. I somehow feel its nicer than milk in a paper carton, don't you?" "I was thinking the same thing."
241957*	I'll forgive you just this once.
6595655	I'm sorry for sounding arrogant.
4700646*	Could you come back here tomorrow at 2:30?
4992074	If "internationalization" means putting every little thing into English, then I think "internationalization" is a load of shit.
3664141*	You have beautiful hands.
5899622*	Your hair's beautiful.
4036443	I've waited forever for this day to come.
4014860*	Have you seen any good movies lately?
4586816	Has something fun happened lately?
4641829	You're in awfully good spirits today, aren't you? Did something good happen?
3670160*	How much do you like Tom?
322709*	Are you sleepy?
322709*	Are you sleepy?
322709*	Are you sleepy?
3662855*	You look sleepy.
3749196*	Everyone looks tired.
2464878	This video is not available in your country.
619636*	Do you come here often?
984512*	May I ask how old you are?
4533471*	I'm sorry I'm so stupid.
3687376	May I call you tonight? "Sure."
4987208	Excuse me, what queue is this?
250468	Will you help me with my English homework?
3688537	Once you've decided when you'll be coming, let me know.
6561679	Do you know what Pocket Monsters means in English?
2014383*	What do you want for Christmas?
1218346*	What did you do last Christmas?
6112110	With whom are you spending Christmas?
4554234*	Tom, who are you going to spend Christmas with?
62811*	What did you get for Christmas?
4631360	Do you think Santa exists?
4525582*	If you don't behave, Santa won't come.
4942336	How many Santas are there?
4942336	How many Santas are there?
4717559*	I wonder if there really is a Santa Claus.
3689965*	How old were you when you stopped believing in Santa Claus?
4717637*	Santa Claus is really just dad, right?
2248215*	I'm pretty sure.
3698987*	Would you like another beer?
2236977*	Tom isn't in.
1094667*	Tom didn't say that.
2214131*	Tom! What are you doing?
2647928*	Tom isn't like you.
4717531	I exercised like I used to, and now I'm all worn out.
5956839	Are you at home now? – "Yes, I just got in."
3408148*	How did your test go?
3424156*	Do you want some ice cream?
3962591	Sorry, I'm 30 minutes late because I overslept.
3402377*	I'm glad I could help you.
731142	What is your occupation?
3739827*	Are these yours, Tom?
4644991	I got you a present, here you go. "What, for me?! Thank you!"
2082981*	Let's not talk about it anymore.
2046908*	Tom is busy making breakfast for the family.
3702230*	Do you know why spring rolls are called spring rolls?
3844659	Good morning. Isn't this rain amazing?
4644993	Why do you hate me so much? "Because you are a brute!"
3189152*	Do you hate me?
3705033	The snow is beautiful, isn't it? "Yeah, but Mary, you're even more beautiful."
3895189	Dad, what are you doing?
273120*	I want you to return the book I lent you the other day.
1886888*	Is this seat open?
953247*	Don't cry.
3739823*	What's the matter, Tom? Are you crying?
6478545	Recently, I've been crying every day. I feel too anxious about the future.
4633576	Why are you sleeping in a place like this?
4008780*	Why are you out at this hour?
3739819	When I grow up, I'm going to get married to Tom.
4644649	Let's get married when we're older! "Yeah!"
3709621*	I don't want to grow up.
2016646*	I want to go to bed early tonight.
3709608*	You look tired, so you should go to bed early.
2248404*	I've messed up.
38002*	Which is mine?
1886790*	What did Tom say about me?
3739814*	Who would you rather go out with, Tom or John?
4717558*	I'll come back tomorrow if I can.
6544481	Can you tell me tomorrow's schedule?
3856547*	Hey, it's snowing.
4641500	Sorry. Was that a weird thing to ask? "No, no. It's not that." "Well, how come you won't answer?"
6586301	I want to become faster.
3713664*	I can't wait to go to college.
3962603*	Is it OK if I touch this?
1542551*	What did you just say?
4644971	Did you just say something? "No, I didn't say anything."
3713960*	Would you tell me your email address?
1243624*	That's my CD, isn't it?
3715331	A good sentence is not necessarily a good example sentence.
3719732*	Are these all your books, Tom?
4525579*	If you get sleepy, just tell me.
3721225	It seems that these days there's a murder somewhere every day. "Indeed. It's a dangerous world, isn't it?"
60947*	What do you think of this sweater?
4650563	Who's your favourite classical music composer? "Debussy."
3126561*	Why do you dislike Tom so much?
4717526	How are you so good at English?
6106130*	I wish the rainy season would end soon.
4644981	Good morning. The snow is piled up outside. "Really!?"
2944128*	Let's change the topic.
36442*	Why do you say that?
4569171*	Why are you so good at cooking?
3856494*	Why are you so smart?
4539272	Click on "log in" at the top-right corner of the screen.
3719785	How late did you stay up last night? "We were up until about 2:30."
1972625*	Feel this. It's really soft.
3748438	What time is it? "2:30." "Really? I wanted to go to sleep early today, too."
5516202	Sorry, I only meant it as a joke.
4572725*	I tried not to cry today.
6040011	Who a person is is not determined by what they look like.
4641472	I look forward to speaking with you again.
3748433*	Looks like today will be a long day.
953107*	Are you on Facebook?
2765612*	I love you, Tom.
526826*	Do you really mean that?
3748427	What are you doing for New Year?
3748424	Why don't you try this? It's delicious, you know!
4717585	It was good chatting like old times. Let's talk again some time.
2261894*	Have you forgiven Tom?
3753285*	Are there any direct flights between Boston and Sydney?
1839618*	What're you doing?
3767559	Are you an American?
3767559	Are you an American?
1977734	Are you American?
2666720*	Do you have a book?
3608062	I live in Malaysia.
3424489	Mary is one of my favorite authors.
1545871	I am thirsty.
3767565	What are you doing for New Years?
5825022*	Why can't you do that?
3768655*	I have the feeling that I've seen these shoes somewhere before.
4635503	So, yesterday I went and met up with that guy I met on the internet. "That Tom guy you're always talking about?" "Yeah, that guy." "Well, how was it?" "He wasn't as attractive as I had hoped."
4921978	He may be the slowest one in our class.
4642859	Lately I've had the feeling there has been someone following me constantly.
3882692	If you want to lose weight, the best thing to do is to eat properly and get a lot of exercise.
3783774*	I wish I could live my life doing only what I wanted to do.
4635487	What the heck is the point of eyebrows anyway?
4717649	I wonder who this bizarre law is for.
3783051*	I'm happy I could help.
2954109*	Wait. What did you just say?
3785273*	We're finally alone.
3784171*	You don't have to say anything you don't want to say.
4635481*	Why am I always the one who has to suffer?
3300464*	Why do you always take Tom's side?
4635479	Why are you always so damn proud of yourself?
3788695*	Let me know as soon as anything happens.
610369*	What's this smell?
2210914*	Why don't you take your coat off?
4635477	I feel like I finally have some understanding of how Tom felt in that moment.
4635475	Don't you think elementary schoolers are taller these days?
3805442*	A long time ago when Pluto was still a planet, there was a boy named Tom.
1103101*	Today I want to eat something light.
3962665	The French word "soleil" means "sun".
4641736	I've heard that there's a new cake shop near the station that makes delicious cakes.
3804968*	It seems I'm going to be up all night tonight.
2663365*	Call me if you have a problem.
3807774*	If it's a good day tomorrow, let's go to the river to swim.
4635473	You don't like alcohol? "No, I like drinking, I just have terrible tolerance."
2164	At this rate, we're not likely to be done before the end of the week.
4942071	The weekend can't come quick enough.
4923225	I wish summer break would hurry up and get here.
4635472	What are you doing in a freezing place like this?
30836*	I wouldn't do it if I were you.
3174092*	Why is French so difficult?
1665*	Is it bad?
348790	My hovercraft is full of eels.
4817737	すいません、これいくらですか？
4638451*	I've bought some cream puffs. Do you want one?
3850971*	Which do you like better, Coke or Pepsi?
2692364*	Who told you that?
4564210*	Is the movie theater near the station?
1064334*	Do you know this song?
3962585	Does it taste good? "Yeah, it's good."
3865845	Are you hungry? "No, not really."
3962588	Please look at the map on page 25.
280864*	Look at the map on page 25.
4635461*	Do you have any other hotels you would recommend?
239441*	Cheer up!
4290055*	Is there something you want to buy?
2946394*	Cheer up.
372787*	How have you been recently?
933733*	Excuse me. Who are you?
6488229	Tom saw my diary without permission!
4635459	People born in January, February, and March, please gather over here.
1276906*	I've already finished reading this book.
2956539*	Tom didn't pass today's exam.
311819*	She wanted to go out anyway.
2013090*	Why do you want to meet Tom?
442130*	That's a good idea.
274491*	Watch your step.
2762840*	Do you want me to help?
240641*	Aren't you thirsty?
435198*	You're lying, aren't you?
1140043*	What are you crying for?
3878782*	Really? I didn't know that.
3875882*	Is this computer connected to the Internet?
2199654	On your mark, get set, go!
1843651*	Leave me some ice cream.
3880690	She likes miniskirts.
315375*	She likes blue dresses.
3881462	Even if you aren't hungry, you should eat something. Otherwise you won't last until lunch time.
2094824*	Everyone knows that.
4635458	Nothing makes me happier than eating good food.
4635452	Do you hate me? "No." "So do you love me?" "Why are you asking?"
5884334	When it comes to little girls, their priority is listening to other little girls.
3930162	Your voice is strange. What's wrong?
5948068	Oh, no! I may have lost my passport.

4352873*	Can you wait about an hour?

4300640	Oh, god. It's raining.
4297291	That hurts! Stop it!

6475996	Mary is doing things precisely.
4515071	There is power in Tom's eyes.

4298720	This summer resort is no longer as popular as it used to be.
4300645	I'm so sorry about yesterday.
4300736*	Is this really spaghetti?
4411464	Before graduation, I went to visit my teacher to express my gratitude for everything he'd done for me.

4331121	Tom is refreshing, honest and a good young man.
4331097	Tom's whole face shows what he is thinking.
4354006	Tom unintentionally expressed his feelings, but did not let me know what he was thinking.
4354005	I felt for Tom, who was away from home, when he said in a lonely voice, "It doesn't snow here."
4354004	I was thinking that Tom could be a vegetarian. He had a cabbage roll.
4354002	While I am gone, please don't forget to feed my cat and water the plants.
4354001	I spent a one month holiday in Japan and it was wonderful.
4331056	Excuse me but may I ask for your name and contact information?
2203356*	Tom is single.
4351992	Those who know nothing but the countryside have no sense of countryside, and those who have not set foot outside the city do not know what a city really is.
4491320	In the countryside, the breaths of the grass, the trees, and the rocks have the foul smell of humans. They call to me from all directions, and they cling to me. But in the city, even the passengers of a jam-packed train are as quiet as pebbles on the riverbed, and everyone is only thinking of themselves.
4354000	Does Meiji University have a medical school?
4378281	I stepped on something weird.
4353999	Kick! Kick!

2123573*	It's Tom.
2203860*	Hug Tom.
4353656	The kid kept all of his money in a piggy bank.

4393838	After years of womanising, Tom finally settled down with Mary.
4394753*	You're going to Boston next week, right?
4394696	It is perfect.
4620706*	I don't want to watch television.
4394683	That is not Tom.

1259631	Janet Jackson had a wardrobe malfunction.
4405097*	I'll go wash my hands.
4397659*	Did you notice any errors?

17125*	What do you do?
56994*	This is the most interesting.
4515082	It must be great to be tall. "Do you think so? It's not really that great. You keep bumping your head on the ceiling."
4486496	It looks like the typhoon is getting closer. "Yeah, it's going to suck if school's cancelled tomorrow."
277736*	It's been raining since morning.
953505*	I know that I don't deserve you.
4460824*	I can't remember doing that.
4515066	After eating the ice cream, my stomach began to hurt.
1840167*	Thanks for the comment.
1841588*	See you later.
540088*	Do you have a boyfriend?

4486485*	I like Irish music.
4917611*	What souvenirs did you buy?
4459809	This is the first time I've caught such a big fish!
2243648*	They're not metal.
2243648*	They're not metal.

4529805*	Tom didn't answer his phone.
2769875*	I'm eighteen.
2544760*	I'm going to the restroom.
