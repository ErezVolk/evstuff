"The harmony of this composition is functional and very much in line with other
standards of its day. The main theme begins on IMaj7 before a minor II - V to the
relative minor; it is not uncommon to hear it approached as Major instead. The A
sections then continue with VImi before a II - V of IV sets up the following section.
The B sections begin on IVMaj7 and continue with bVII7 - IMaj7. B1 proceeds in a
predictable fashion, momentarily staying on II7 before a final II - V back to the tonic.
B2 instead uses a II - V of III which deceptively resolves to the final turnaround of
IMaj7 - IV7 - IIImi7 - VI7. The changes have proved to be immensely popular amongst
soloists and have also been used as the basis for compositions such as "Split Kick" by
Horace Silver and "Not You Again" by John Scofield."


There will be many other nights like this
And I'll be standing here with someone new
There will be other songs to sing
Another fall, another spring
But there will never be another you

There will be other lips that I may kiss
But they won't thrill me like yours used to do
Yes, I may dream a million dreams
But how can they come true
If there will never ever be another you?
